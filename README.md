Multi-Tenant Expense Management System
Tech Stack: Spring Boot, Hibernate, PostgreSQL (multi-tenancy), JWT Authentication, RabbitMQ, AWS S3.

# Expense Management System

## Overview

This is a **Spring Boot** application designed for managing expenses. It includes user authentication via **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens), expense management, and integrates with **PostgreSQL** for data persistence. The project allows users to register, log in, and manage their expenses through a simple API.

### Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure login and API access using JWT tokens.
- **User Registration**: Register new users with password encryption (using BCrypt).
- **Expense Management**: Add, view, and delete expenses.
- **PostgreSQL Database Integration**: Stores user and expense data in PostgreSQL.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework used for building the RESTful application.
- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For secure authentication.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing user and expense data.
- **BCrypt**: Password hashing algorithm.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build automation.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/expense-management-system.git
cd expense-management-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **Java 17** or later and **Maven** installed.

To install dependencies, run the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### 3. Configure PostgreSQL Database

1. Install **PostgreSQL** if you don't have it installed already.
2. Create a new database for the project, e.g., `expense_management`.
3. Update the `application.properties` file located in `src/main/resources` with your PostgreSQL database credentials:

```properties
# PostgreSQL Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/expense_management
spring.datasource.username=your-username
spring.datasource.password=your-password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```

### 4. Run the Application

You can run the application using the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Database Setup

Make sure to set up your PostgreSQL database properly. You can use the default configuration or change the `application.properties` to suit your needs. The database tables will be created automatically when you run the application.

---

## Security

The project uses **Spring Security** with **JWT** to authenticate and authorize users. The `JwtAuthenticationFilter` intercepts requests and validates the JWT token, while the `JwtTokenUtil` is used to generate and validate JWT tokens.
