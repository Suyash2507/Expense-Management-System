Implement multi-tenancy using Hibernate and PostgreSQL.
Integrate RabbitMQ for asynchronous notifications.
Work with AWS S3 for file storage and retrieval.

Why Itâ€™s Unique: Covers multi-tenancy (a key feature for SaaS platforms), cloud storage, and messaging, all of which are relevant for scalable backend systems.
